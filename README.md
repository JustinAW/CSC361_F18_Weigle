Zeppelin Raiders

The player will play a human character in a steampunk world that is augmented with steampunk gadgets. There will be different characters to choose from.

The player will have to navigate across a multitude of in-flight zeppelins searching for all the great loot on board to build up their wallet. 

In addition to more funds, there will be some consumable upgrades such as a steam powered jet-pack and a grappling hook.

The player will be able to navigate forwards and backwards through the world jumping from zeppelin to zeppelin.

The background will have a cloudy sky and other zeppelins passing by as well as a city scape of steampunk architecture near the bottom.

There will be steam blasts from the character and the zeppelins periodically as the machines operate on steam power.

These steam animations will come along with sound effects to go along with the themed music in the background.

The menu will allow the player to change their character prior to starting the game. After that it will allow toggling the music and sound effects as well as adjusting their volume.

There will be animations for both the jetpack and the grappling hook as well as any other powerups, and also the player movement will have a running animation.

The players score will be determined by the amount of money they have accumulated throughout each level.
