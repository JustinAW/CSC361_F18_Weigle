Eskimo Joe

- The main character of the game is Eskimo Joe

- The player will have to navigate Eskimo Joe over glaciers

- Eskimo Joe needs energy to continue on, he gets it by collecting fish, which
  will also give the player points toward their score
  
- The player will be able to pick up snow shoes that will last for a limited
  time before breaking.
  
- Eskimo Joe will be a dynamic object, the glaciers will be static objects,
  and there will be floating ice platforms that will be kinematic objects that
  will sink after Eskimo Joe stands on it for too long.
  
- Eskimo Joe will be able to move left, right, and jump from platform to
  platform
  
- The background will consist of snowy mountains and a cloudy sky
  (and possibly arctic wildlife)
 
- Eskimo Joe will create a particle effect of kicking up snow as he navigates
  the glaciers
  
- There will occasionally be sounds of ice cracking as Eskimo Joe lands on the 
  glaciers, as well as a sound effect when the floating ice platforms sink of
  it submerging
  
- When the game starts there will be a menu screen with melodic music that sets
  the mood for the cold world the player is about to be a part of.
  There will be a cold, windy air soundtrack playing as Eskimo Joe travels the
  frozen terrain. This will be able to be turned off or down via the menu.
  
- When Eskimo Joe is standing still, the player will be able to watch as his 
  jacket, hood, and ribbon tied to his walking stick are blown around in the
  cold, arctic breeze.
  
- As already likely noted, the player will be navigating Eskimo Joe through the
  arctic on a series of glaciers and floating platforms. The goal is to get
  Eskimo Joe back to his igloo.
  
- The player will be scored on how many fish they have collected, and Eskimo Joe
  will have an energy drain that is refilled by the collection of fish. If the
  players' energy reaches zero, it will slowly eat at their score until it is
  zero at which point Eskimo Joe will die from lack of energy stores. There will
  be a high score board to record the players that best navigated the world
  collecting fish at the most efficient rate.
